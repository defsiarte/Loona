<h2>Her Musical Journey</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;Heejin is the first member of Loona. She debuted on September 26, 2016 as a member, and released her solo single album "HeeJin" on October 5, 2016.<br><br>
&nbsp;She debuted as a member of the group's first sub-unit, LOONA 1/3, on March 7, 2017 with the mini album Love & Live.
That following October, Heejin, alongside fellow members HyunJin and HaSeul, became contestants on the survival show MIXNINE, representing their agency and group. She ranked 4th place in the finale, however, was eliminated when the boys' team won against the girls', thus ultimately not being able to debut.<br><br>
&nbsp;Her nickname is Heekki <span class="kr">(희끼)</span>, which is a portmanteau of her name and the word for rabbit <span class="kr">(토끼)</span>. She originally gave this name to the rabbit she met on set while filming her first MV.

<h2>About Her (In Real Life)</h2>    
<p>&nbsp;HeeJin first wanted to become a singer when she was in middle school. At one time, both her sisters had similar dreams, but those dreams were ultimately unrealized. HeeJin has stated that one of the reasons she became a singer was to make her sisters’ unfulfilled dreams come true, and has cited her sisters as being her biggest supporters.<br><br>

&nbsp;In pursuit of her goals, HeeJin traveled long distances in order to attend a dance academy. Her father began discouraging her dreams of becoming a singer after she was rejected at 20 different auditions. However, in 2015 she was cast through social media by BlockBerryCreative and became a trainee. HeeJin trained for one year before she was selected to be the first member of the agency’s upcoming girl group.</p>

<h2>About Her (In Loonaverse)</h2>   
<p>
&nbsp;Many believe that her ambition in life is to paint the LOONAVERSE in color, in which she enlists the help of her other members. In all of HeeJin's pre-debut promotional photos she wore white, symbolizing her purity. This can be confirmed further by the Attendance Cards. Every pre-debut single contained an attendance card, that could be brought to a LOONA fansign. If the owner of the card managed to get every member of LOONA to stamp their attendance card they would be given the opportunity to meet the members at the LOONAbirth concert. Each card featured the members' individual color based on the album. For example Chuu's single comes with a peach-colored card, while HyunJin's comes with a yellow-colored card. But the only member of LOONA whose card was not their individual color, was HeeJin. Her card is white instead of hot pink, which further suggests her purity as well as the beginning of the LOONAVERSE. She represents the blank, white canvas that the other members must fill with their colors.
