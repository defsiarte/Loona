Its description reads "LOONA discovered destiny in between coincidence and fate.

LOONA, predicting that a new moon will rise, decide to hold a festival in the concert of moonlight at [12:00], when the Moon radiates the brightest light before it expires, one where not even a single girl is oppressed. Having created coincidence by colliding fate against fate, and discovered destiny between coincidence and fate, LOONA delivers a new message through the midnight festival. With all LOOΠΔs around the world; like this slogan of the album, that message says that all LOONAs of the world are always together, that all are dignified and equal, worthy to earn freedom. The combined voice of the girls, who face the beginning of a new moon, is cast into the world."</p>
